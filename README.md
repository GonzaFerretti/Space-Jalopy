# Space Jalopy
The year is 2053. You are Bronco, a space bounty hunter who rides a 2010â€™s Viper Model A. It may be a jalopy for most people, but you know that the old reliable Vipey never lets you down. Everyone knows a little fix here and there mid-flight is part of the fun, as long as it doesn't get out of control.

Try and eliminate the biggest space fugitive to claim your reward and finally step down from the job and live the good life you deserve. 

This game was made in 48hs for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 edition (July 10th 2020 to July 12th 2020). The theme being out of control we decided to give the player a jalopy space ship that starts going out of control randomly, expected after so many years and adventures. The player needs to choose if he wants to be exposed to repair his ship or start relegating control of it.

Music, art and code was 100% made by our team.
